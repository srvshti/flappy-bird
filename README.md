DQN with PyTorch â€“ Flappy Bird
This project implements the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm using PyTorch to train an agent to play Flappy Bird. It is based on the tutorial series by @johnnycode.

Features
Deep Q-Network from scratch with PyTorch

Experience Replay

Epsilon-Greedy strategy

Target Network for stable training

Tested on CartPole and Flappy Bird

Includes Double DQN and Dueling DQN improvements
